_**This purpose of this post is you can transfer file between your mac and iphone without sync your iphone into itunes. Here is the guide.**_

_**Prepare your iphone**_ : make sure that your iphone is jailbreaked, open cydia and search for openSSH then install it. You must be on same wifi network to transfer your file, open settings – wifi – name of your wifi network – and find your iphone ip address there (example 192.168.1.102). You must reboot your iphone to make change.

_**Prepare your mac**_ : download cyberduck [here](http://cyberduck.ch/) as SFTP client for your mac, then create new connection with cyberduck, choose SFTP as protocol, type your iphone ip address, use root as username and alpine as password (default password)

Once the connection open, you can simply drag and drop your file to your iphone directory
